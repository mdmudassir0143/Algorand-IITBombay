# Algorand-IITBombay
Design and development of Smart Contract applications for Algorand Blockchain
Algorand is ablockchain created by Turing Award winner Silvio Micali. IIT Bombay is part of an Algorand Center of Excellence led by Purdue University, called MEGA-ACE. One of the objectives of MEGA-ACE is to build applications on top of the Algorand Blockchain, such as a CV registry for easy verification of CV details, land record registry etc. This project will involve building such applications, using the TEAL language used by Algorand. A basic understanding of blockchains would be desirable before the internship begins.
