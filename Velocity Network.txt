													Velocity Network

The labor market is volatile and disrupted, with skill shortages, high turnover rates, and a contingent workforce.
The current methods for exchanging employment history, achievements, and education data are costly, slow, and self-reported.
The Velocity Network Foundation aims to reinvent how career records are shared using blockchain technology, creating the Internet of Careers.
The network is designed to be trusted, private, and effortless for individuals to take ownership of their career credentials.
Employers and education providers can rely on trusted, verifiable, and immutable data, improving productivity and compliance.
Velocity Network Foundation is a membership nonprofit that aims to give people back control over their career assets and build a globally accessible, trustworthy utility layer that connects the world of work.
